# Handwritten digit recognition - using Tensorflow in Python

● Implemented a digit recognition model using the MNIST dataset and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
● Identified the handwritten digit from its image with >85% accuracy.
● Created a flask app to handle user requests from the front end and render html using template engine.
● Deployed the app to heroku.
